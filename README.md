# java_stockManagement Desktop Application(Swing framework)
A very basic stock management application.(Desktop)

-MySQL used for database management,  
-Xampp used in order to construct a local server via MySQL,  
-Netbeans IDE used to develop the application.

P.S: This application is my first application in my programming life.I had not heard of the word "best practice" back then :D
